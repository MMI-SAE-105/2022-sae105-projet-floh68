        <p>Detroit has long been the centre of the automotive industry. It was founded by French-Canadian fur trader Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, Sieur de Cadillac.Detroit has also been home to some of the biggest names in the automotive industry, including General Motors and Ford Motor Company. The city's strategic location along the Great Lakes and the Detroit River made it an ideal place for transportation and commerce. The city's population exploded in the early 20th century with a large influx of European immigrants from countries such as Italy, Poland, Ukraine and Germany. From then on, Detroit became a major industrial centre with a diversified economy in 1907 when General Motors (GM) was founded there.</p>

      <div><h2 class="sous-titre">Le déclin à long terme de Detroit et ses raisons..</h2>
        <p>Detroit is one of the most iconic cities in the United States. It is also one of the most economically deprived areas in America. The city has been in long-term decline since the 1950s and this continues to this day. Detroit's population has fallen from 1,850,000 to 677,000 over the years and continues to decline.</p>
          <p>The reasons for this decline are complex but can be summarised as follows:</p>
          <p>- Decline in manufacturing industry</p>
          <p>- High unemployment rates</p>
          <p>- Lack of investment in public services and infrastructure</p>
          <p>- Poor education system</p>
          <p>- Racial tension</p>
