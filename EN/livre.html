      <div><h2 class="sous-titre">Summary of the book</h2></div>
      <p>The automobile was invented and refined over the years by men with a special imagination and a passion for mechanics. Later, designers endowed this mechanism with attractively shaped casings. Thus, simple mediums were transformed into true artistic creations: they are considered masterpieces that fascinate, captivate and testify to an art practiced by great masters.</p>

      <div><h2 class="sous-titre">Excerpt from the book :</h2>
        <p>In the 1970s, Ital Design also designed the Porsche Tapiro concept car, the Alfasud Caimano, the Audi Karmann Ace of Spades, the Maserati Boome rang, the Hyundai Pony Coupé (which marked the beginning of a collaboration with the South Korean firm), as well as the New York Taxi, a concept car made for the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Designed by Giugiaro, this small but spacious (six seats) urban vehicle can easily accommodate a wheelchair passenger or even a pram. </p>
        <p>Ital Design designs and builds the MI for BMW. The firm also designs the Lancia Delta, the Audi 80 and the one that, for many, is the prototype that inaugurated the era of the minivan: the Lancia Megagamm based on the New York Taxi. In 1982, Giugiaro improved the MPV concept with the Capsula, so high that it looked like a double-decker. Later, Giugiaro would transform the minivan/monospace into a maxivan with the Columbus prototype. </p>
        <p>There are prototypes for Renault, Saab, Fiat, Subaru and Toyota, but also research prototypes such as the Machimoto, a hybrid car/motorcycle-bicycle. Then, in 1988, the Sgard, the Aspid and the Aztec, surprisingly avant-garde prototypes, like the Bertone BAT thirty years earlier. A few years later, Giugiaro's son Fabri zio, aged 26, made his debut in mobile car design with three Nazca prototypes for BMW. </p>
        <p>The idea of relaunching Bugatti gave rise to some fascinating prototypes during the 1990s. while a series of concept cars and production cars were also designed: the Jaguar Kensington, the Lucciola, the Lamborghini Cala, the Formula 4 and Formula Hammer, the Alfa Romeo Scighera and the Volkswagen W12 Synchro. Then Ital design celebrates its thirtieth anniversary with the Structura prototype, characterised by the aluminium "space view" chassis. </p>
